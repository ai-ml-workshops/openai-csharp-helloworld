# OpenAI Hello World example with C#
This is the C# version of the hello_world.py shown as part of the CodeMash presentation.

It uses the .NET port of LangChain and uses the OpenAI API.

## How to run

* Prereq: Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 8.
* Clone this repo
* Get an OpenAI API key (see SystemPrereqs repo for more info)
* Add an environment variable with the key
* Build. This will load the LangChain package.
* Run
* Ask it a question, like "What is codemash?"

This should work as is. You may get errors about your OpenAI account if it doesn't have a balance or if the key is wrong.
